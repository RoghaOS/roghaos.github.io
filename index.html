<h2>RoghaOS</h2>
<p>Rogha and Eolas, two words from the Irish language.</p>

<p>Rogha meaning choice, freedom.
RoghaOS is an operating system for PCs and a firmware for IoT devices,
<br>focusing on giving users and administrators freedom to use their OS the way they intend.</p>

<p>Eolas means knowledge, information.
We mean access to information and knowledge,
<br>from the basic things online to the OSes Heart source code.</p>

<p>RoghaOS was initially imagined being used as a universal Operating System for Education Institutions,
<br>being easy to manage and deploy to many devices.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Our Vision is to provide something you can rely and depend on.
<br>Rogha will not change all the time and have a waterfall of frequent versions like other OSes do.</p>

<p>This way you can use your time for things that matter the most,
<br>your creations, your control and your management.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter your profession or area, RoghaOS is made for everyone.
<br>For people who simply want to turn their device on and be productive without having to find out where a button had moved to.
<br>Giving you the choice to thinker with the OS and change things if you like.
<br>With RoghaOS we aim to produce a robust, modular,
<br>flexible and stable platform that respects your rights and your choice.

<h3>Ideal</h3>
<p>The choice to choose and do things the way you want.
<br>Or simply the choice of leaving things just the way they are and not changing them.

<p>RoghaOS will not ever go thorough any major change that would affect your workflow.
<br>We understand and care about the way you do your work.
<br>Make a shell script to automate a task or port a game to RoghaOS and rest assured,
<br>it will still work just the way you intended for many years to come.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>We are committed to provide a reliable and consistent experience to everyone running RoghaOS.</p>

<p>Learn Once Use Many. Learn and train for the OS once and use it for many times and many years,
<br>contrasting some other Operating Systems that have drastically changed their user interface,
<br>forcing people and companies to spend money and time adapting to the OS,
<br>RoghaOS is committed to a stable GUI design.</p>

<p>No dramatic UI changes.
<br>We have only a fixed and static API and guideline,
<br>develop for our standard and keep your app alive for ever.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>RoghaOS have to main parts:
<br>Eolas the bottom layer, which is where the Kernel, Drivers, APIs and low-level stuff lives,
<br>it has no GUI (Graphical User Interface) and it is text based, intended to be used remotely, in IoT applications and as well NAS (Network Attached <br>Storage) and Firewall applications.</p>

<p>The GUI is called Rogha, similar to the whole Operating System but without the “OS” part.</p>

<p>This approach is done in many other Operating Systems and facilitates the development and maintenance of the platform,
<br>some examples of other Operating Systems that have been following this approach are:
<br>OpenIndiana, forked from OpenSolaris, built on top of the illumos project.
<br>macOS, the whole OS is named macOS but the under the hood portion of it is called Darwin, which is a Unix-based BSD.
<br>Windows, originally Windows was just a layer siting on top of MS-DOS.</p>
